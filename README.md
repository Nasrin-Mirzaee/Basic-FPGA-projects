# Basic-FPGA-projects
Basic VHDL

📘 Purpose

This repository provides a set of small, educational VHDL projects for students learning digital logic and FPGA development with ISE.
Each project focuses on one core digital concept, making it ideal for beginners who want to understand how basic hardware components are implemented and simulated in ISE.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This collection is designed to help beginners:

Learn the basics of VHDL syntax
Understand common combinational and sequential logic elements
Practice creating and simulating designs in ISE
Build a foundation for more advanced FPGA design

🛠 Tools & Requirements

To work with these projects, you will need:
Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.x (recommended)
Optional FPGA development board (e.g., Spartan-3/Spartan-6 based boards)
A basic understanding of:
Digital logic
VHDL

ISE workflow (project setup, simulation, synthesis)
